<p>The year 2020 for almost every person is considered to be an unfortunate year. Un unexpected virus has been already disturbing human life spaces: A freedom environment has become a limited-outdoor activity.</p>
<p>Quarantine is seen as drawbacks: It changed our socialized habits. Friends have to use online remote apps in order to maintain their bonds instead of holding a party gathering together. Those who are obsessed with outdoor sports probably will surfer a tough time for a quite while.</p>
<p>Self-isolation is also can be seen as advantages: It creates sufficient inner spaces for individuals to go exploring better themselves. A chunk of time will be used for self-development. Reading, spending time with loved ones, meditation, learning a new skill which has been eager for, etc. Those are exactly helping us gradually melting the icebergs of our own lonely spirits.</p>
<p>For me, personally, Covid-19 changed my life tracks. Under high pressure for almost 1 year, I had been feeling tremendous anxieties and panics from my studies in Ugent. One decision I made was directly dropped out of school from the hustle and bustle. I only wanted to run away from everything that I had experienced in Belgium. It was a little nerve-wracking, at the same time, it crashed my self-confidence system, and, the abilities of feeling joy and pleasure had infinitely gone downward spirals. I spend almost 4 months after back in China for healing this trauma. The process was not that easy as imagination. Sometimes it went back when I just felt I could overcome it successfully. I told myself over and over again: '' It is okay, because everybody else is tackling his/her troubles on his/her own dimensions as well.''</p>
<p>The key point for helping me straight forward jumped out of the death circle was when I started thinking of my life path shouldn't be trapped into a relative stability point, if I cannot move on, I will stay there forever for the rest of my life. With that mindset, eventually, after a few times of straggling, I got it over. Now, when I looked back these days, I can only find glories rather than gloominess. The darknesses had always ended up in a point that a faint flame has never ever been burnt out.</p>
